NNs (Neural networks) is a beautiful biologically-inspired programming paradigm which enables a computer to learn
from observational data

Deep learning is a powerful set of techniques for learning in neural networks

CNNS (Convolutional Neural Networks or ConvNets) are a form of multi-layered deep NNs designed to recognize visual
patterns (edges,lines, circles, squares, etc) directly from pixel images with minimal processing

mostly used for image recognition, image classification, face recognition, object detection, etc

each input image passes through a series of convolution layers with filters (Kernal) and apply the softmax function
to classify an object with probabilistic values between 0 and 1

the convolution layer is a mathematical operation that takes two inputs such as image matrix and a filter or kernel

one can apply different filters to perform different operations say edge detection, blur or sharpen
